  Computer architecture introduction. Machine Code introduction. How C relates to asm.

* [Programming for Wannabes. Part II. Systemcalls](part-02.md)

  Syscall introduction. Using syscalls from C and asm. Stripping down binaries (removing standard libs)

* [Programming for Wannabes. Part II and a half. Systemcalls (ARM and MIPS)](part-02.5.md)

  Part II for ARM and MIPS

* [Programming for Wannabes. Part III. Your first Shell Code](part-03.md)

  Processor Native Word Size. HW Memory Models. Pointers. Convert Hello World into a shellcode

* [Programming for Wannabes. Part IV. The Stack](part-04.md)

  Stacks. Function parameters, prologue and epilogue. Stack Frame. Local variables. Buffer overflows and Canaries concepts
